<h2>This document provides some explanation for fitting the logistic regression model using the XSB Prolog system.</h2>

<p>To run the code in this repository, you need to install a recent version (tested with 5.0) of the XSB Prolog system, available at https://xsb.sourceforge.net/.</p>

<p>The instructions below assume that XSB has been started on the command line, in the main folder of the repository. </p>

<h3>Replicating the analyses in the paper</h3>

<p>After starting XSB, the logistic regression model predicting disappearance of juveniles can be fitted by calling the following command on the XSB command prompt. </p>

<p><code>
?-  [myricaria_germanica_ecology],  load_rows('db_myrica.csv'), disappeared_models(_,Results).
</code></p>

<p>This returns a list of terms of the form <code>result(AIC,LL,Features,Coeff)</code>, sorted by AIC value, where the coefficients are given in the same order as the features. The final coefficient in the list is the intercept. </p>

<p>The log-linear model predicting channel width can be fitted by calling the following command on the XSB command prompt. </p>

<p><code>
[myricaria_germanica_ecology],  load_rows('db_myrica.csv'), channel_models(_,Results).
</code>
or simply 
<code>
channel_models(_,Results).
</code>
if <code>[myricaria_germanica_ecology]</code> and  <code>load_rows('db_myrica.csv')</code> have already been executed in the same XSB session. </p>

<p>This returns a list of terms of the form <code>result(AIC,RSS,Features,Coeff)</code>, sorted by AIC value, where the coefficients are given in the same order as the features. The final coefficient in the list is the intercept. </p>

<h3>Brief explanation of the three Prolog files in this repository.</h3>

<p>To load the code into XSB, run  <code>[myricaria_germanica_ecology].</code> from the XSB shell. 
This loads the utilities in <code>mg_ec_data_utilties.P</code> and the regression code in <code>regression.P</code> and provides a simple top-level command to perform the analyses reported in the accompanying paper. </p>

<hr />

<p>The data is provided in (semicolon-delimited) DSV format.</p>

<p>It is loaded using the <code>load_rows/1</code> predicate provided by <code>mg_ec_data_utilties.P</code>, which asserts it into the dynamic database. This file also contains all the auxiliary predicates for semantically parsing the rows.</p>

<hr />

<p>The code performing the regression is contained in <code>regression.P</code>. </p>
